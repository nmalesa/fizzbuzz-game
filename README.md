# FizzBuzz:  The Game

## Save your fizzy drink from the buzzy bees!

In FizzBuzz, you are given a random target number. For every number from 1 to the target, multiples of three will print <strong><em>Fizz</em></strong>, and multiples of five will print <strong><em>Buzz</em></strong>. Multiples of both three and five will print <strong><em>FizzBuzz</em></strong>!

The object of the game is to guess how many times the word <strong><em>FizzBuzz</em></strong> will appear.

### Requirements

To play FizzBuzz, you must have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) on your local machine.

### Installation

Clone this repository to your local machine.

Inside the `app` directory, run `yarn install` to install dependencies.

### Running the Game

FizzBuzz uses a build tool called [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/).  From the `app` directory, run `yarn dev` to start the Parcel development server.

Parcel will launch the application on [http://localhost:1234](http://localhost:1234).  (Note that Parcel may default to a different port if 1234 is already being used.)

### Testing

FizzBuzz includes a test suite.  To test, run `yarn test` from inside the `app` directory.  Test results should display in the console.

Happy fizzbuzzing!
