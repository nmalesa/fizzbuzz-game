# About Me - Natalia Malesa

I am a full-stack software engineer with a focus on UI / UX. I have experience building engaging, responsive web and mobile applications using a variety of technologies, including React, React Native, and SwiftUI.  I love creating great user experiences that improve accessibility and data visualization while optimizing content for mobile users.

I am flexible and learn quickly, and I enjoy exploring new directions in UI / UX.  Two examples in which I researched and implemented new strategies for displaying interactive web content via mobile include creating a Progressive Web App (PWA) with React and building a UI web feature within a native iOS app using Vue and web views.  I am also adept at communication and collaboration in a fast-paced environment.  I continue to grow my skills as a developer by learning new patterns to improve performance and scalability and write cleaner, more maintainable code.  I will bring creativity and a commitment to life-long learning to your team.   

An example of something I built to solve a business problem is the open-source package, [react-native-atomic-file-ops](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-atomic-file-ops).  In our React Native app, we encountered a bug with Android 10 in which writing to an existing file corrupted that file.  We built react-native-atomic-file-ops in order to prevent file corruption during writing.  I built the iOS feature.  I wrote an article, [How to Test if Your React Native Module Integrates with Android and iOS](https://betterprogramming.pub/how-to-test-if-your-react-native-module-integrates-with-android-and-ios-aa18f43f296a) on how we tested the package and how to incorporate integration testing into the React Native development process.

I also write poetry.  I was once paid three dollars for a haiku I wrote about the dancer and choreographer [Vaslav Nijinsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaslav_Nijinsky), which was published in <i>[Haiku Journal](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34757821-haiku-journal-45)</i>.
